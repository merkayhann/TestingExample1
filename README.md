# TestingExample1
This is an example of how I conduct automated software tests. It contains how to test logging in on the website Goodreads and 
it checks if the top navigation bar works as it should. 
Also the link to the excel file that contains a few examples of how I conduct manuel 
tests is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12bDdza3QQ56S8tyhsQyddqrCTuLNhKcmnP0ZiMiGqXQ/edit?usp=sharing
These manuel test examples are also of the website Goodreads, and a few of the Play Books website.
